# romeosDopeYoutubeProject
I made this becasue I don't like YouTube's subscriptions box. It often breaks and also it tracks you because you have to be logged in to use it.
I built this with the help of ~Gamah and Mitfree so that now I don't have to log in to YouTube anymore to get a subscription box, and I feel like this one does the job better anyways.
To add your own channels, put the channel's xml feed in the *feeds.txt* file. Feel free to remove the channels that I put there. 
Also, you might want to wipe out *history.txt* so that you're not wasting processes sifting through my watched videos. Keep in mind that the first line has to be occupied by something. I suggest "FILLER" but you can use whatever.
This script doesn't accept any launch options or anything, so just run it with python3 and it'll do its thing.
